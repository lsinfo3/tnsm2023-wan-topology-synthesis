# attribute_sampled_networks
contains (i) the scripts to sample weights onto the GAN- and 2K-generated networks and (ii) the actual networks themselves as a .pkl file which are NetworkX graphs (nx.Graph()).

# convert2omnet
contains the scrips to convert all the approaches to proper omnet files (.ned files, .ini files etc.)

# omnet-files
contains the omnet-files which are the results of the convert2omnet scripts

# plot_data
contains the data we used for our performance metric plots, as well as the rest of the graph metrics (for the sampling approach) plots. for the other plots please revisit the original paper git: https://github.com/lsinfo3/cnsm2022-wan-topology-synthesis. note: the files for the sampling approach are split into three .zip files due to upload constraints.
